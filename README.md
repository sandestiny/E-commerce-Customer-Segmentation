E-commerce Customer Segmentation

Abstract:
A key challenge for e-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the
market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the

companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the e-
commerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like

previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on.

Problem Statement:
Given the e-commerce data, use k-means clustering algorithm to cluster
customers with similar interest.

Dataset Information:
The data was collected from a well known e-commerce website over a
period of time based on the customer’s search profile.

Variable Description:
Column Description
Cust_ID Unique numbering for customers
Gender Gender of the customer
Orders Number of orders placed by each customer in the past

Remaining 35 features (brands) contains the number of times
customers have searched them

Scope:

Problem Statement – K means
● Analyzing the existing customer data and getting valuable insights
about the purchase pattern
● Data pre-processing including missing value treatment
● Segmenting customer based on the optimum number of clusters (‘k’)
with the help of silhouette score

Learning Outcome:
The students will get a better understanding of how the variables are
linked to each other and will be able to apply cluster analysis to business
problem such as customer segmentation.
